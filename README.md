# `Flint++`
## A Cross Platform Port of Facebook's C++ Linter

`Flint++` is cross-platform, zero-dependency port of `flint`, a lint program for C++ developed and used at Facebook.

This project was motivated by a desire for a modern and extendable C++ Linter that just worked. Facebook had already done a fantastic job with their `flint` project; but through an unnecessarily high number of dependencies, poor documentation, and OS dependent coding the project is almost unusable. `Flint++` aims to solve these problems by only using the C++11 std::library along with a minimal number of polyfill functions developed to bridge the gaps in the needed functionality.

The original `flint` is published on [Github](https://github.com/facebook/flint); and for discussions, there is a [Google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/facebook-flint).

Upcoming Features

Usage
-----

	$ flint++ --help
	Usage: flint++ [options:] [files:]

	-r, --recursive		  : Search subfolders for files.
	-c, --cmode			  : Only perform C based lint checks.
	-j, --json			  : Output report in JSON format.
	-v, --verbose		  : Print full file paths.
	-l, --level [def = 3] : Set the lint level.
			            1 : Errors only
			            2 : Errors & Warnings
			            3 : All feedback

	-h, --help		      : Print usage.

Does it pass Linting itself? 
-------------------------

### Yes!
	
	$ flint++ ./

	Lint Summary: 14 files
	Errors: 0 Warnings: 0 Advice: 0

Compiling `Flint++` from source
-------------------------------

From the flint subdirectory, use `make` with the included makefile to build on a Posix based system using G++ > v4.7. To run the simple output test case run `make tests` after compilation. This will run `Flint++` on the test directory and compare its output to the text stored in `tests/expected.txt`.

Why Lint?
---------

Linting is a form of *static-code analysis* by which common errors and bad practices are flagged for review. This can help to both optimize poorly written code and to set a unified code style for all the code in a project. For large organizations this can be tremendously powerful as it helps to keep the whole codebase consistent.

Dependencies
------------

### Windows, Unix, Linux, OSX

**None!** You're good to go! Happy linting :)

*Edit:* It's not really a dependency, but it's worth noting that this project makes extensive use of the C++11 Feature Set. You probably won't be able to compile it on a Pre-C++11 version of your compiler. 

Tested On
---------

So far I've managed to compile and test `Flint++` on Windows 7/8/8.1, Ubuntu 14.10, and Raspbian Wheezy; compiling under MSVC++ '13 and G++ 4.8 respectively. Edit: We also have word people have successfully compiled under OSX with Clang 3.5
